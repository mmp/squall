# Introduction

This document briefly describes wgrib2, a utility and library for 
interacting with, reading, writing, and manipulating GRIB2 files.

Wgrib2 is maintained as a collaboration between [Climate Prediction
Center (CPC)](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/) and the [Environmental
Modeling Center (EMC)](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc.php).

## Installation

Download the tarball from the release page and unpack it, and cd into the main directory of the library. Then run the following commands, substituting your directory locations for the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (where wgrib2 will be installed), and the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (where the build will look for dependencies):

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/NCEPLIBS-g2c;/usr/local/NCEPLIBS-ip" <Additional CMake options>
make
make install
```

Additional CMake build options can be used to configure the build by setting them with `-D<OPTION>=<VALUE>`.
